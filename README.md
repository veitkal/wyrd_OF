What follows is a program creating generative weaving drafts/notations/constructs
and patterns to be printed in real time with a thermal printer.

A computational, emergent system of "entities" based on turmites/Langtons Ant
is feeding the draft with their current states. By using optical flow/computer
vision, via ps3EyeCam, the system and the drafts are interacted with and
influenced.
